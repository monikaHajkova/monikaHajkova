I am originally from Slovakia but have been living in Ireland since I was 10 years old.

I'm a big animal lover, with the exception of spiders 🙅‍♀️🕷️. I have two guinea pigs living at home, Pickles and Pepper, that I love to bits. 🐹

In terms of activities I like to surf 🏄‍♀️ (even though I'm not very good at it 😅), and cycle, I like going on hikes and walks 🏔️, I'm a part-time gym goer 🏋️‍♀️ and I enjoy a bit of yoga 🧘‍♀️. In my spare time I like to play video games 🎮, read books, watch TV, and sometimes paint 👩‍🎨
